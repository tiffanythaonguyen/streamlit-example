st.markdown("""
This Streamlit App allows you to import data and clean it using the mitosheet library. The app is preconfigured with a set of data checks and prompts you to fix specific issues in the data.

It ensures that your data has the following properties:
- The first column is the issue date, and it's of type datetime.
- The issue date column is a datetime column.
- There are no null values in the issue date column.
- The Notes column is not included in the dataframe.
- The term column is an integer.

**Why is this app useful?**
This app could be used in the first step of a data engineering pipeline. It allows data engineers to help data analysts ensure their data conforms to a specific schema before they continue their analysis.

In this app, only if the user has fixed all of the issues in their data will they be able to export the data to a CSV file. You could update this app to export the data to a database instead.
